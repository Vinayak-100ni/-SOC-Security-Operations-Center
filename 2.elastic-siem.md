# 📘 Elastic SIEM (Elastic Security) – Complete Guide in Simple Words

## 1. What is SIEM?

**SIEM = Security Information and Event Management**

SIEM is a system that:

* Collects logs from many devices
* Stores them in one place
* Finds threats or suspicious activity
* Alerts security teams

**In short:**

> SIEM = Log collection + Detection + Alerting + Investigation

---

## 2. What is Elastic SIEM?

**Elastic SIEM (Elastic Security)** is a SIEM solution built using the ELK Stack:

* Elasticsearch → Stores data
* Logstash → Processes data
* Kibana → Shows data & alerts
* Beats / Elastic Agent → Collects data

It is used by **SOC analysts** to:

* Monitor logs
* Detect attacks
* Investigate incidents
* Respond to threats

👉 Elastic SIEM is **faster + scalable + cheaper** than many traditional SIEM tools.

## 4. Main Components of Elastic SIEM

```md
1. Elastic Agent / Beats – Collect logs from systems
2. Logstash – Filters and processes logs
3. Elasticsearch – Stores and indexes data
4. Kibana (Elastic Security) – Dashboards & alerts
5. Detection Engine – Finds threats using rules
6. Timeline – Used for investigation
7. Case Management – Used for incident handling
```

### Types of Beats

| Beat Name  | Purpose         |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Filebeat   | Reads log files |
| Winlogbeat | Windows logs    |
| Metricbeat | System metrics  |
| Packetbeat | Network traffic |
| Auditbeat  | Security events |

---

## 5. What Elastic SIEM Provides

Elastic SIEM can:

✅ Collect logs
✅ Detect attacks automatically
✅ Create real-time alerts
✅ Provide dashboards
✅ Support threat hunting
✅ Store logs for investigation
✅ Help in incident response

---

## 6. Elastic SIEM Use Cases

```md
1. Detect brute force login attacks
2. Detect malware or ransomware
3. Monitor suspicious admin activity
4. Identify data exfiltration
5. Detect port scans
6. Monitor login failures
7. Cloud security monitoring (AWS / Azure)
8. Insider threat detection
9. Monitor USB insertion
10. Identify unusual network traffic
```

**Example:**

> If someone tries wrong password 10 times → Elastic SIEM will create an alert.

---

## 7. Role of SOC Analyst in Elastic SIEM

SOC Analyst uses Kibana to:

* Monitor dashboards
* Check alerts
* Investigate suspicious logs
* Create cases
* Escalate incidents

**SOC Analyst levels:**

* L1 – Monitoring & Alert handling
* L2 – Investigation
* L3 – Threat hunting & deep analysis

## 8. Elastic SIEM vs Traditional SIEM

| Feature       | Elastic SIEM | Traditional SIEM |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Cost          | Low / Free   | Expensive        |
| Speed         | Very fast    | Slow             |
| Scalability   | High         | Limited          |
| Cloud support | Excellent    | Limited          |
| Customization | Easy         | Hard             |
| UI            | Modern       | Old              |

## 9. Simple Working Explanation (For Interviews)

Memorize this:

> “Elastic SIEM collects logs using Beats/Elastic Agent, processes them through Logstash or ingest pipelines, stores them in Elasticsearch, visualizes and correlates data in Kibana, and then SOC analysts monitor, investigate and respond to security incidents.”
